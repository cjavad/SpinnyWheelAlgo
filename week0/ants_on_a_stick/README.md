# 7 [∗∗] Ants on a Stick

Suppose that you have 100 ants on a stick of length 100 cm. At the start, each ant is placed
at some position on the stick, pointing either toward the left or right end of the stick. Then, all ants begin to move
simultaneously. The ants all move at a speed of 1 cm per second. If an ant bumps into another ant they both immediately
reverse directions and continue at the same speed, and if an ant reaches the end of the stick it falls off the stick. What is maximum duration of time before all ants have fallen off the stick over all possible initial placements of the ants?
